        <h2>What is Universum?</h2>
        <p>
            Everyone wants to create a language, which is the problem with modern constructed 
            languages and one of the greatest difficulties of establishing a truly universal 
            language. Not many have a vested interested in learning a new or constructed language 
            because these languages tend to lack any practical use initially and it's not possible 
            to actively contribute to its development or creation. This is why Universum is 
            different. It is designed with a basic framework containing uninspired root terms 
            unique to Universum and basic phonemes that are used throughout the world. The values 
            of these root terms are fluid and adaptable to various contexts, meaning the language 
            can be used universally and there is plenty of room for expansion. Speakers can 
            actively contribute to the development of the language by reinforcing the essence of 
            these terms and collectively introduce new terms and compounds, which are analyzed 
            and evaluated using machine-learning algorithms to improve the language accordingly.
        </p>
        <h2>Why Universum?</h2>
        <p>
            Universum is a language that transcends the boundaries of traditional communication.
            It's a language that adapts to the modern tongue, incorporating elements from a wide
            range of linguistic traditions to create a truly unique and versatile form of
            expression. If you'd like to take part in creating this new language or you'd like to
            employ Universum for its clarifying effect on thought and expression, then you've
            come to the right place. Universum is designed to be accessible to everyone, regardless
            of their linguistic background or experience.
